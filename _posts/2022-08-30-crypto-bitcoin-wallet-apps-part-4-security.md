Apps relative to crypto are very recent.
We wanted to study those Apps to make an smart article about technical stacks & good practices.

This article is the last of this serie :

# App Security

The security score is actually evaluated by checking 3 things : 
- detect "risky" files inside the app bundle (something human readable that might contains important informations)
- detect bad security configuration 
- detect api keys/token easy to hijack

**A risk for you?**
- The risk can be detected for the End User, for example, if the security layer is removed of the HTTP exchange.
- The risk can be on the Company side, for example, if some secrets are easy to discover just using the app binary like i did.

## Risks due to the App configuration

Each Apps can adapt a very important security layer between the App and internet.
In this section, we scan the Apps [NSAppTransportSecurity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsapptransportsecurity) configuration.

Only 2 Apps don't modify this security layer 
- MetaMask - Blockchain Wallet
- Crypto.com  - Buy Bitcoin, ETH  
  
  
The others Apps are reducing the App security using some parameters
- **NSAllowsArbitraryLoads** : A Boolean value indicating whether App Transport Security restrictions are disabled for all network connections.
- **NSAllowsLocalNetworking** : A Boolean value indicating whether to allow loading of local resources.
- **NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent** : A Boolean value indicating whether all App Transport Security restrictions are disabled for requests made from web views.
- **NSExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads** : A Boolean value indicating whether to allow insecure HTTP loads.  
  
  
## Risky keys/values

Some places inside the App are protected and not easy to read (for exemple the executable element of the App).
In a lot of Apps, we can detect some important keys/values not stored at the right place.

Only 3 Apps are not storing critical value in a low security environement
- MetaMask - Blockchain Wallet
- CoinMarketCap
- FTX (anciennement Blockfolio)           

## Risky files
  
An package App is not so complicatd to get and to inspect.
The packaging is not a good protection because an App package is just a zip file ðŸ¤¯.
AppScan analyse the entire content of the package :
- Main bundle,
- Each bundles,
- Each librairies, frameworks,
- All files in the App.

The idea is to detect files that can contains infomrations in a more or less readable format.
All those files with extensions has been detected in the Apps.

- **.cer, .der**, those files are certificates, probably to if the server is really the real server
- **.xml, .yml**, data files, fully readdable, we can get lot of informations exploring them 
- **.json**, fully readdable, we can get lot of informations exploring them 
- **.xcconfig**, really not a normal place in an App ... it's a configuration file for Xcode
- **.md, .txt**, text files ... sometimes readMe, release notes, etc 
- **.js**, yes, some JS files can be very interesting and contains lot of data.

## Conclusion

- MetaMask is over the other, we only detect some .cer & .der files which can be usefull for security validation
- Lot of Apps are exposing apiKeys & critical tokens inside readable sources (Info.plist for example)
- Too much Apps are updating the NSAppTransportSecurity ... this parameter reduce the App security
- I would consider Apps to be more secure because alternatives create more data inside "readable" format (.json, .txt, .js, .yml). Those files can contains important data.
