Since the beginning of this project I have been wondering.
It's it so important for the end User to use an App that is not developed natively.
For my part, i am too much in love with the Apple ecosystem & Swift.

So I was wondering if we could detect and measure an impact on the choice of technology used to develop the application.

In this study, I decided to focus on Apps rankings, using 10566 Apps scanned by AppScan.

# Native is dominiting the Apps development

- Native development is far ahead
- Globally, without a focus on the top ranked Apps, we detected 75% of native Apps, which is very close to the first 1st article of that blog [the 1st article]({% post_url 2022-06-28-app-technologies %}) 
- If we look from the Top 100 to the Top 10, the pourcentage increase at every step.
- Finally, if we study only the 401 Top 10 Apps, 81.3% are fully native.

## React native at the second place

- ReactNative is the number 2.
- If we look to the Top 100 to 10, React Native is pretty stable. (is it a sign of maturity?)

## Flutter, the challenger?

- Flutter is the number 3.
- To the Top 100 to 10, Flutter decrease at every step.


## Impact of the technology on rank, conclusion

If your goal is to take a seat in the top ranked Apps, developing a native app seems mandatory. ReactNative et Flutter are good challengers.
I forgot to mention Cordova & Xamarin in this study but the numbers are small than Flutter and the correlation pretty similar (less and less pourentage on each steps to the top 10)

## But .... how is ranked an App? 

While writing this article I had some hesitations...
How does Apple decide to rank an app?
Is it just a fair result?
