**why?**
We have created an AppScore : 
- To be more objective to judge a App
- Detect strenghts and the weaknesses of the App.
- Be able to compare Apps

AppScore computation is the sum of multiple scores:

**App environment** - Xcode version can be detected. It's interesting to see the adoption of the most recent version of Xcode to adapt the App to new iOS features.

**Technology use for the development** - Major technology used for the App development, can be evaluated using some packaging hints.

**App minimal iOS version** - Give an estimation of the reachable number of devices

**App size** - Tt's big or not? And detect why

**App permissions** - Give an interesting smelling of the possible features of the App

**App supported languages** - Give a best vision of the targeted users

**App resources** - Discover some optimizations and packaging errors

**App librairies** - Super tech vision of the App Technical Stack and guessing some features and the strategy of development

**App security** - God dam shit

**App - interactions with other Apps** - Users love to be heard

**App - interactions with the iOS system** - Yeah! Very good points to be loved by Apple and maybe the Users
