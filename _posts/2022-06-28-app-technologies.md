Since 10 years i have seen a lot of cross-plateform technologies.
Every time, there is some reasons to select an alternative technology.

- Reduce the cost of the App
- Use the internal resources to develop the App
- Recruitment too complex 

For several years, we the maturity of some challengers, i was wondering if I was missing something.
That's why i have made this analyses of the AppStore. 

The alternatives are : 
  - [Native](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/xamarin) (Apple)
  - [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) (Facebook)
  - [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) (Google)
  - [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) (Adobe Systems)
  - [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/xamarin) (Microsoft)

We have collected the analysis of 3334 apps

| Syntax      | Number of Apps | %    |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| Native      |     2494  | 75%   |
| React Native   | 420        |  12%     |
| Flutter   | 159        |  5%     |
| Cordova   | 107        |  3%     |
| xamarin   | 34        |  1%     |
| Web   | 120        |  3%     |
  
  
**This picture of the store is interesting!**

- At least <span >25%</span> of the Apps of the AppStore are not native! 
- 2 technologies are dominating Flutter & React Native.
