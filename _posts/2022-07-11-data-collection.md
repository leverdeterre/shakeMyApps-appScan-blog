I started to work on that project some years ago. I was working another project RocketSkill, a quizz App for the tech recruiters.
I was trying to aggregate lot of data to get a global vision of the AppStore and give some recommandations to new iOS developers. 
What libraries are important to know? How to improve my learning curve on the platform?
  
After some months, i was able to generate a first list of frameworks sorted by usage of the AppStore.
This was already funny to discover some new frameworks using this method.
  
Finally, i decided to continue my research about the ipa structure & organizations and to conclude i made the AppScan tool, to collect & organize the App data.
