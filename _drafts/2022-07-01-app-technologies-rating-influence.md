Is it possible to make a great app using an alternative technology. 
First, we need to clarify *What is a great App?*

On my side, i consider it's the case when the users are happy and give you good vibes & good ratings.
Studying the top Apps since some months give me a pretty nice vision on the most used technologies to publish.

| Syntax      | Number of Apps | %    |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| Native      | 199       | 85%   |
| React Native   | 1        |  %     |
| Flutter   | 1        |  %     |
| Cordova   | 1        |  %     |
| xamarin   | 1        |  %     |
| Web   | 1        |  %     |
