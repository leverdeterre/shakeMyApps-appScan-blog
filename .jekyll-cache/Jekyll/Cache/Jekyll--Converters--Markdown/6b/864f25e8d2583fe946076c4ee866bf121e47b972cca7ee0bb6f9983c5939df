I"Ø<p>I started to work on that project some years ago. I was working on an other project RocketSkill. 
I was trying to generate a global vision of the AppStore to give some advises to new iOS developers. 
What libraries are important to know? 
How to improve my learning curve on the plateform? 
After some months, i was able to generate a list of frameworks sorted by frequency of the AppStore.
This was already funny to discover some new frameworks using this method.</p>
