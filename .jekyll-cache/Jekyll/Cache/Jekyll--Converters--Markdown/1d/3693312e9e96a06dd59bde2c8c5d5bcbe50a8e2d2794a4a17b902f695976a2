I" <p>To be more objective to judge a App and be able to compare Apps, we have created an AppScore. 
We are not going to rate the features of the App but we wanted to be realist of the strenghts and the weaknesses of the App.</p>

<p>AppScore computation can be devided into scores:</p>

<p><strong>Dev environment</strong> - Xcode version can be detected. Itâ€™s interesting to see the adoption of the most recent version of Xcode to adapt the App to new iOS features.</p>

<p><strong>Technology use for the development</strong> - Major technology used for the App development, can be evaluated using some hints.</p>

<p><strong>App minimal iOS version</strong> - Interesting to know the reachable number of users</p>

<p><strong>App size</strong> - Discover how the App is packaged</p>

<p><strong>App permissions</strong> - Give an interesting vision the possible features of the App</p>

<p><strong>App supported languages</strong> - Give super complete vision of the targeted users</p>

<p><strong>App resources</strong> - Discover some optimizations and packaging errors</p>

<p><strong>App librairies</strong> - Super cool vision of some features and the strategy of development</p>

<p><strong>App security</strong> - God dam shit</p>

<p><strong>App - interactions with other Apps</strong> - Super cool vision of some features.</p>

<p><strong>App - interactions with the iOS system</strong> - Super cool vision of some features.</p>
